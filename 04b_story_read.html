				<h2>The Glove</h2>

				<p>Harold walked sullenly out of his home. It was a modest home on a modest street in Midwestonia, a city of around 100,000. Harold was pensive. He’d forgotten to take the trash out the night before and his wife Angie had gotten upset at him. His apologetic demeanor had only made her more aggravated, as he wasn’t used to standing up for himself, especially his wife, whom he hoped would be more understanding.</p>

				<p>With head drooped, he slunk out of house, depressed at the idea of returning to his bank job. The job itself was quite decent, but his boss was an asshole. The kind of overly aggressive Gordon Gecko slick backed hair types who’d been used to working on the trading floor with other alpha males, but had been relegated to manage the retail arm of the bank where Harold worked. Unfortunately, he too disliked a man who didn’t stand up for himself, and so he disliked Harold.</p>

				<p>Harold managed to avoid his boss, and waited patiently for a customer. Occasionally he would stare a home he’d seen for sale online. The kind of place he’d like to buy for his wife and teenage son Tim, so they could finally be happy together and so that they would how hard he was trying for them. His thoughts were interrupted.</p>


				<p>'I'd like to open a checking account please.'</p>
				
				<p>Harold glanced up at the young girl standing in front of him. She held a few papers, which she shuffled nervously.'No problem. Let's get you started,' Harold said as he began typing things into the computer. This girl was unfamiliar; twenty years in this town and Harold knew most everyone. 'You new in town?'</p>

				<p>'My parents moved here this summer.'</p>
				
				<p>'You know, I have a son about your age, you at Jefferson High?'</p>
				<p>Bringing up Tim was a gamble, Harold wasn't sure he was even making it in to school most days, but small talk was part of the job.</p>

				<p>'Tim Meyer? He's a junior.'</p>
				<p>The girl shook her head without recognition.</p>
				<p>'Well, look out for him maybe.' Harold said with a smile. A pretty girl might not provoke the same hostility in Tim that Harold himself did. 'Just don't tell him I sent you. I'm not his favorite person at the moment.'</p>

				<p>The girl left after the usual account niceties, and Harold got up to take a bathroom break. The bathroom door was right next to the elevator and for some inexplicable reason Harold decided right then and there to avoid pissing, and instead left the building.</p>

				<p>It was freedom. Freedom from work, from his wife, his son who he’d disconnected with. Everyone. The downtown area wasn’t that big, but Harold walked about 2 blocks before seeing something on a park bench.  It was an ordinary leather glove.  Nothing special, and it looks fairly old.  But Harold was transfixed.  He snatched up the glove and immediately put it on.  He didn’t know why. It just seemed the right thing to do.</p>

				<p>Almost immediately the world changed, he was king of the hill, a new man.</p>
